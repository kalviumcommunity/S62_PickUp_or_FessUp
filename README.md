Project title - PickUp or FessUp

Project Overview:

It is basically a website where a user first creates a account in which he/she inputs a username, email ID and gender. Then as he/she wishes, they can post a pickup line or a regret that they had. Other users of this website can interact with this post and can give the flirts a rating out of 10. On the regrets side, people can either add a comment to a regret or react with an emoji. If the owner of the regret post deletes it, it will just show a funny/silly randomly chosen message.

Key features:

For pickup lines:

A more flirty themed user Interface which has a button to post a new pickup line, a button to delete the pickup line and another input area where other users can rate it. My idea is to make the user interface as easy to navigate as possible allowing for easy and seemless traversal of the page.

For regrets:

This page will have a more dark theme to it. It has one button where users can post a regret, another button where they can delete and a place where other users can either comment on the users regret or they can just react to it with a emoji.

Tech Stack:

The MERN STACK and additional things if required.

Why this project:

I chose this particular idea as the only thing told to us was to pick something "'as silly as possible". To me, this project seemed like a fun and silly idea to create. It seems interesting to me because I think it is something that hasnt been done before at all and that makes it a personal milestone for me to complete. I'll be using a lot of creativity for it for the User Interface as I have never come across a website that does both of pickuplines and regrets at the same time. I will also be learning MERN STACK for the first time as a result of which I will be developing skills on this topic.
